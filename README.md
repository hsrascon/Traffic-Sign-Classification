# Traffic-Sign-Classification
Classify traffic signs using a deep neural network 


Overview
---
In this project, you will use what you've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. You will train and validate a model so it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model is trained, you will then try out your model on images of German traffic signs that you find on the web.

The Project
---
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Load the data set
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
